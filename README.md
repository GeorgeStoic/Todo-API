<h1>Simple Todo API on vanilla PHP üêò</h1>

---------------------------------------

This is an api written on vanilla php without any third party library or framework.

Easiest way to handle api requests on php without frameworks and oop.

For database there's used MySql to store data.

It also has basic sql injection protection with <strong>parameterized queries</strong>

Supported methods: ``GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE``

Disclaimer! <strong>Today it is not recommended to use vanilla php to make api, for such projects it is reccomended to use Laravel or Symfony frameworks, which grants more flexibility and security fo a code
  That code is just example of api on vanilla php and nothing more

For usage you have to change ``connection.php`` file and add there credentials of your database (database should contain Id(AI), title and body tables)
